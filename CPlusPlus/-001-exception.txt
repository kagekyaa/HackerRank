problem on final worth 6 points about Exception, regular problem worth 3 points.
sample on top of NameSpaces slide.

--------
mySpace becomes a center of attention for pedophile.

--------

NameSpaces: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5cb46ksf.aspx
scope: //tldr: some function has same name, by using namespace, find it from that scope

//using namespace std;

std::cout
myNameSpace::cout

^ need to force namespace if both scope has same function name.
both become invisible, so eventho "using namespace std and using namespace myNameSpace is called"
cout alone cannot be called.
